**SDR++ Community Edition** is a community-driven fork of SDR++ - a cross-platform and open source SDR software with the aim of being bloat free and simple to use.

### 🎯 **Mission: Community-First Development**

This Community Edition exists to address the gap in community contributions and feature development. While the original SDR++ project has established a solid foundation, many valuable user-requested features and improvements have remained unaddressed due to restrictive contribution policies.

**Our commitment:**
- ✅ **Welcome ALL contributors** - from beginners to experts
- ✅ **AI-enhanced development friendly** - we embrace modern development tools
- ✅ **Rapid feature development** - addressing user requests that matter
- ✅ **Transparent review process** - all contributions are reviewed fairly
- ✅ **Community-driven priorities** - features requested by users, built by the community

### 🚀 **New in Community Edition**
- **MPX Analysis for FM Broadcasting** - Real-time multiplex signal analysis with frequency spectrum visualization
- **Enhanced Configuration Management** - Improved settings persistence and architecture
- **Build System Improvements** - Better macOS support and ARM compatibility
- **Comprehensive Documentation** - Architecture guidelines for contributors

### 🤝 **Contributing**
We actively encourage contributions! Whether you're fixing bugs, adding features, improving documentation, or enhancing the user experience - **your contribution is welcome**.

**How to contribute:**
1. Fork this repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your improvements
4. Submit a pull request
5. Engage in the review process

**No contribution is too small** - from typo fixes to major features, we value all community input.
